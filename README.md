# Newsletter

A php and webbased simplistic newsletter/mass mailing tool.

News can be composed by a convient wysiwyg editor, which is capable of embedding images directly into the newsletter mail.
Templates can be used to give the newsletter a common style.

The storage is filebased which means it will run on very limited webservers. There is no need for an sql database. All you need it atleas PHP5 and sufficient space.
Private data like mail addresses is protected by a simple xor encryption.
